##Flot-Labels
===========
A simple plug in for [Flot](http://www.flotcharts.org/) to draw labels next to plotted data points.

v 0.1 initial check-in
v 0.2 Updated to add using canvas.fillText to draw labels instead of adding divs to the DOM. Provides better support for printing graphs in some browsers.
